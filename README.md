# instructions
The applications expect to run on port 3000 and 4000, so try to have those free if you can. 

1) in a terminal cd into CLONE_HOME/playmate-news-server and run 
    
    node start.js
    
   The server will be running on http://localhost:4000 and will serve up the GraphQL edit tool directly from there
   
2) in a terminal cd into CLONE_HOME/playmate-news-client and run 

    npm start
    
   the server will start and a browser window should automatically open on http://localhost:3000 
   
   
 That's it
